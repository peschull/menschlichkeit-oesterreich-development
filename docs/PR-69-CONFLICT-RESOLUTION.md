## ✅ Solution: Dependabot Rebase

The simplest and safest solution is to ask Dependabot to rebase the PR. This will:
1. Rebase the dependency update on top of the latest main branch
2. Resolve any conflicts automatically
3. Update the PR with the rebased commits

## 🚀 How to Resolve

### Method 1: Manual Comment (Recommended for humans)

1. Go to the PR: https://github.com/peschull/menschlichkeit-oesterreich-development/pull/69
2. Add a comment with **exactly** this text:
   ```
   @dependabot rebase
   ```
3. Submit the comment
4. Dependabot will automatically:
   - Acknowledge the command
   - Rebase the PR branch
   - Update the PR with rebased commits
   - Resolve conflicts

### Method 2: Using the Script (Automated)

If you have a GitHub token with appropriate permissions:

```bash
# Set your GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-personal-access-token"

# Run the script
./scripts/resolve-pr-69-conflicts.sh
```

The script will:
- Validate the token
- Post the `@dependabot rebase` comment
- Confirm successful posting
- Provide status updates

### Method 3: Using GitHub CLI (if available)

```bash
# Comment on the PR
gh pr comment 69 --body "@dependabot rebase"

# Monitor the PR status
gh pr view 69
```

## 📊 Expected Outcome

After running the rebase command:

1. **Immediate:** Dependabot acknowledges the command with a comment
2. **Within 1-2 minutes:** Dependabot pushes rebased commits
3. **Result:** PR shows as "Ready to merge" (no conflicts)
4. **CI/CD:** All checks re-run on rebased commits

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After Dependabot rebases:

```bash
# Fetch the updated PR
git fetch origin pull/69/head:pr-69-rebased

# Check the commits
git log pr-69-rebased --oneline -5

# Verify no conflicts with main
git checkout main
git merge --no-commit --no-ff pr-69-rebased
git merge --abort  # Clean up test merge
```

Expected: No conflict messages should appear.

## 📝 Additional Dependabot Commands

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

The pyjwt update from 2.8.0 to 2.10.1 is important because:
- **Security patches** may be included
- **Bug fixes** that improve stability
- Keeping dependencies up-to-date reduces security vulnerabilities

After merging, verify:
```bash
# Check the updated version
cat api.menschlichkeit-oesterreich.at/requirements.txt | grep pyjwt

# Expected: pyjwt==2.10.1
```
