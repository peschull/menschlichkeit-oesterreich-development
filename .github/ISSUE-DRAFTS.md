- Implemented:
  - Redis-backed queue with endpoints: /queue/push (Idempotency-Key), /queue/pop, /queue/ack, /queue/fail (exponential backoff, DLQ)
  - /queue/stats for monitoring (main/delayed/dlq, oldest_age)
  - n8n workflows: WebhookQueue_Processor, Queue Monitor (Slack + email alerts), DLQ Admin (manual)
  - JWT protection for queue and /civicrm passthrough (allowlist)
- Next:
  - Optional: Idempotency TTL configurable, DLQ inspector UI in frontend (partially added: AdminQueue page)

Suggested comment for #145:
> Backend queue + monitoring delivered. Added JWT-protected endpoints (push/pop/ack/fail/stats, DLQ list/requeue/purge), idempotency support, n8n workflows (enqueue + worker + alerts), and a basic Admin Queue page. Propose to close and track UI polish under a follow-up issue.
