## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Only works for Dependabot PRs** - This command is Dependabot-specific
2. **Requires write access** - Must have permissions to comment on PRs
3. **Case sensitive** - Use exactly: `@dependabot rebase` (lowercase)
4. **One-time action** - Only need to comment once

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If rebase fails:
- Try `@dependabot recreate` instead (recreates PR from scratch)
- Check if there are actual code conflicts (rare for dependency updates)
- Review Dependabot's response comment for error details

### If Dependabot doesn't respond:
- Wait 2-3 minutes (might be processing other requests)
- Check if Dependabot is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the comment is exactly `@dependabot rebase`

### If you don't have access:
- Ask a repository maintainer to post the comment
- Request write access to the repository
- Use the GitHub Actions workflow (if you have Actions access)
